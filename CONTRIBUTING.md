### 🌐Translating

#### **Translate Plugin Messages**

Since the plugin messages are translated by AI, there must be some mistakes in the translation. If you find any mistakes
(or inappropriate translations), there are two ways to help us improve the translation:

1. Fork the repository & clone the repository to your local.
2. Create a new branch for your translation.
3. Translate the plugin messages.
4. Commit & Push your changes to your fork.
5. Open a pull request, wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Plugin messages are located in the `languages` directory. Translate the files in the language you want to

- If the language you want to translate to does not exist, create a new file with the language code (e.g., `zh-cn.yml`
  for Simplified Chinese).
- If the translation is not up-to-date, please update it from the `zh-cn.yml` file.
- Don't forget to leave your name in the header-comment of the file.

> Plugin messages was uploaded to Crowdin too, you can directly modify the translation on
> the [Crowdin project](https://crowdin.com/project/dominion).
>
> But we **NOT RECOMMEND** this way, because the translation on Crowdin may not be the latest.
