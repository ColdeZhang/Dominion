## Requirements

Environment required to run the Dominion plugin:

- Java 17 or higher;
- Spigot 1.20.1 or higher;

::: tip
Although Dominion supports Spigot, for better performance we recommend upgrading your server core
to [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper)!
:::

::: warning
If you are using a hybrid core (such as Mohist, Arclight), some unknown issues may occur, usually due to incompatibility
between the mod loader and bukkit-event.
These issues are not caused by the plugin itself.
Therefore, we cannot guarantee perfect operation on these hybrid cores, and in principle, we do not accept issues
directly caused by these cores.

If you encounter problems on a hybrid core, please try to reproduce the issue on the Spigot
vanilla core, and then submit the issue with the error or phenomenon on the vanilla
core [here](https://github.com/ColdeZhang/Dominion/issues).

On the GitHub platform, both `lite` and `full` versions are provided, while other platforms only offer the `lite`
version.

- `lite`: This version does not include third-party dependency libraries and will automatically download them when the
  server is started for the first time after installation.
- `full`: This version includes all dependency libraries and can be used directly.

## Installation

Place the downloaded plugin file into the server's `plugins` folder, then restart the server.
