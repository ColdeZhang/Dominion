## Introduction

Dominion uses the configuration in the `limitations` directory to control the restrictions on players creating
territories. By default, players are subject to the restrictions configured in `limitations/default.yml`.

By creating multiple additional configuration files in the `limitations` directory, different restrictions can be
applied to different players. For details, refer to [Group Limitations](/en/notes/doc/owner/other/multi-limitations/).

### Using Different Limitations for Different Worlds

By configuring the territory limitations for different worlds under `world-limitations`, you can apply different
limitations to different worlds.
For example, if you do not want players to claim territory at the top of the Nether, you can copy `default`, modify it
to `world_nether`, and add it under `world-limitations`.
Then change `no-higher-than` to the Y value of the Nether top, `127`.

```yaml{4}
...
world-limitations:
  world_nether: # <<< world name you want to set
    no-higher-than: 127  # <<< the Y value of the Nether top
    ...
  default:   
    ...
```

### About Amount

For example below:

```yaml{1,4,7,10}
amount-all-over-the-world: 10
world-limitations:
  default:
    amount: 5
    ...
  world:
    amount: 2
    ...
  world_nether:
    amount: 2
    ...
```

The maximum number of territories a player can have in the `world` and `world_nether` worlds is `2`, while in other
worlds it is `5`.
If the total number of territories a player has in all worlds reaches `10`, they will not be able to create any more
territories, even if the limit in a specific world has not been reached.
