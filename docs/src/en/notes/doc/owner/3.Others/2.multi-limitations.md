## Introduction

Many times, we want different territory limitations for regular players, sponsor players, and VIP players. For example,
regular players can only claim 10 territories, sponsor players can claim 20 territories, and VIP players can claim 30
territories.

Dominion provides a group limitation feature that allows you to set different territory limitations for different player
groups.
By combining with some third-party recharge plugins, players can automatically upgrade to more relaxed territory
limitations after recharging.

## Configuration Method

### 1. Prerequisites

- Understand the [Dominion configuration file structure](/en/notes/doc/owner/config-ref/overview/) and complete the
  basic configuration;
- Install a permissions plugin, such as [LuckPerms](https://luckperms.net/);

### 2. Prepare Configuration

First, copy the `limitations/default.yml` file and rename it to `limitations/<group_name>.yml`, for example,
`limitations/vip.yml`:

::: file-tree

- limitations
    - default.yml
    - vip.yml

:::

Modify the limitations in the `vip.yml` file to the desired VIP player limitations, then use `/dom reload CONFIG` to
reload the configuration file.

### 3. Configure Permission Groups

Using LuckPerms as an example, open the permissions group and create a group named `vip`:

After creating, add the `group.vip` permission to the corresponding players, then save the LuckPerms configuration to
take effect.

::: tip
This example shows how to configure manually through LuckPerms.

We recommend installing plugins with recharge functionality, which can automatically set permission groups for players,
thus achieving automatic switching of territory limitations without manual intervention.

## Priority

Since most permissions plugins support permission group inheritance, a player may belong to multiple permission groups
simultaneously.

By configuring the `priority` field in each `limitations/<group_name>.yml` file, you can decide which group's
limitations to use when a player belongs to multiple groups.
The smaller the `priority` value, the higher the priority.

Suppose a player belongs to both `vip` and `default` groups. We certainly want them to use the `vip` group's
limitations.
Therefore, we can set the `priority` as follows:

- `vip.yml`: set to `0`
- `default.yml`: set to `1`

This way, when a player belongs to both groups, their territory limitations will use the configuration in `vip.yml`.
