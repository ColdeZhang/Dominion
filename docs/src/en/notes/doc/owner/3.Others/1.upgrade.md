## Major Changes

Dominion 4 mainly restructures the configuration file system, internationalization, and permission checks. Therefore,
users (i.e., you) need to pay attention to the configuration files.

Due to the significant changes in the configuration file structure, this update **cannot automatically migrate
configuration files, and you will need to reconfigure them after the upgrade**.

## Migration Steps

1. First, shut down your server, install the latest Dominion, and then restart it;
2. After restarting, shut down the server again and open the `plugins/Dominion` folder;
3. Refer to the [Configuration File Reference](/en/notes/doc/owner/config-ref/overview/) to reconfigure. The main
   changes in the configuration files are as follows:
    - `config.yml` only retains the territory system settings, and player restrictions have been moved to the
      configuration files under `limitations`;
    - The original `groups` folder functionality has been changed to `limitations`;
