## Introduction

By configuring group servers, you can connect multiple servers to the same database, enabling cross-server
teleportation, cross-server territory management, and other features.

## Prerequisites

- Understand the [Dominion configuration file structure](/en/notes/doc/owner/config-ref/overview/) and complete the
  basic configuration;
- Your server is a group server and has been configured with BungeeCord or Velocity;
- Prepare a MySQL or PgSql database;

## Configuration Method

Based on the issues encountered so far, there are three possible scenarios:

1. Upgrading from a lower version to 4, already in use (data has been generated);
2. Just installed Dominion and not yet in use (no data generated);

### Scenario One

If you were previously using SqLite, you need to first export the database using `/dom export db`, then configure the
new MySQL or PgSql database and start the server once,
import the database using `/dom import db`.
Shut down the server, and continue configuring according to [Scenario Two](#Scenario-Two).

If your previous database was MySQL or PgSql, you can directly refer to [Scenario Two](#Scenario-Two) for configuration
and add other sub-servers.

::: warning
The `server-id` in this server configuration file cannot be modified!

Because the territories in the current database are all set to this `server-id`, modifying it will cause the original
data to be unfindable.
:::

::: info
If you previously had multiple sub-servers, each with its own territory data, unfortunately, we currently do not have a
safe way to merge the data from multiple sub-servers into one database.
You can only choose to keep the territory data from one of the servers.
:::

### Scenario Two

#### 1. Configure the Database

First, configure the database. You can choose to use either MySQL or PgSql, then configure the same database information
in the `plugins/Dominion/config.yml` file of all sub-servers to connect all servers to the same database.

::: warning
Do not start the server immediately after configuration!
:::

#### 2. Configure Server Information

Then configure the server information in the `plugins/Dominion/config.yml` file of each sub-server:

```yaml
multi-server:
  enable: true
  server-name: server
  server-id: 1
```

Among them:

- `multi-server.enable`: Set to `true` to enable the group server feature;
- `multi-server.server-name`: The server name, which should be consistent with the server name in BungeeCord or
  Velocity;
- `multi-server.server-id`: The server ID, used internally by Dominion to distinguish different servers. **This value
  should be a positive integer and unique across all servers**;

#### 3. Start the Server

Finally, ensure that all servers have configured the database information and server information, then start all
servers.
